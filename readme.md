a simple game engine
===

This is a WIP simple game engine for an rpg game.
It is a WIP. This readme is also a WIP, but you can't say I don't have one.

Running
---
You will need to run `game.database.py` to populate the database tables.

There is currently only one client for the game, the Discord client.
You will need to create a Discord app and make sure BOT_TOKEN is in your environment.

Once that is set, simply look at/run `main.py`.


Playing
---
To play the game, you should use a client (the only of which as of this writing is the Discord client.) Follow the
instructions [here](./docs/discord_client.md) to set that up or join a server with one set up already.
