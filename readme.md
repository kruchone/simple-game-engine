a simple game engine
===

This is a WIP simple game engine for an rpg game.
It is a WIP. This readme is also a WIP, but you can't say I don't have one.

Running
---
There is currently only one client for the game, the Discord client.
You will need to create a Discord app and make sure BOT_TOKEN is in your environment.

Once that is set, simply look at/run `main.py`.
